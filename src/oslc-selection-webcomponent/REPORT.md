# OSLC Selection WebComponent - Development Report

## Overview

Created a modern web component that provides an OSLC selection dialog interface using standard HTML dialog elements and iframe communication. The component encapsulates the complexity of OSLC postMessage communication while providing a simple, reusable interface.

## Implementation Details

### Architecture

The component is built as a custom element extending HTMLElement with:

- **Shadow DOM**: For style encapsulation and isolation
- **HTML Dialog**: Native modal dialog support
- **Iframe Communication**: OSLC postMessage protocol integration
- **Event-Driven**: Custom events for selection and cancellation
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptive sizing and mobile-friendly

### Key Features Implemented

1. **Custom Element**: `<oslc-selection-button>` with full web standards compliance
2. **Modal Dialog**: Uses native HTML `<dialog>` element for proper modal behavior
3. **OSLC Integration**: Leverages the postMessage helper for protocol communication
4. **Event System**: Dispatches custom events for selection made and cancelled
5. **Attribute Binding**: Reactive attributes for dialog-url, title, button text, and styling
6. **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

### Component Interface

#### Attributes
- `dialog-url`: OSLC selection dialog endpoint
- `dialog-title`: Modal dialog title
- `button-text`: Button label text  
- `button-class`: CSS classes for button styling

#### Events
- `oslc-selection-made`: Fired with selected resources
- `oslc-selection-cancelled`: Fired when dialog is closed without selection

#### Properties
All attributes are also available as JavaScript properties for programmatic access.

### Dialog Management

The component handles the complete dialog lifecycle:

1. **Opening**: Button click triggers modal display
2. **Loading**: Shows loading state while iframe loads
3. **Communication**: Registers OSLC postMessage listeners
4. **Selection**: Processes selected resources and closes dialog
5. **Cleanup**: Removes event listeners and clears iframe

### Styling and Theming

The component uses Shadow DOM with a comprehensive CSS custom properties system:

- **40+ CSS custom properties** for complete visual customization
- **Granular control** over every visual aspect (button, dialog, header, content)
- **Theme-ready** with pre-built examples (Material, Bootstrap, Dark, etc.)
- **Framework integration** support (Tailwind, styled-components, etc.)
- **No style leakage** due to Shadow DOM encapsulation
- **Responsive design** capabilities through CSS variables
- **Animation support** via transform and transition properties

This approach provides better external styling capabilities than most Web Component frameworks while maintaining encapsulation and performance.

### Integration Patterns

The component supports multiple usage patterns:

1. **Direct HTML**: Simple attribute-based configuration
2. **JavaScript**: Programmatic creation and event handling
3. **JSP Integration**: No-build-required script inclusion
4. **Framework Integration**: Compatible with React, Vue, Angular, etc.

### Browser Compatibility

Targets modern browsers with:
- Custom Elements v1 support
- Shadow DOM v1 support
- HTML Dialog element support
- ES2020 language features

### Error Handling

Includes robust error handling for:
- Missing dialog URLs
- iframe loading failures
- OSLC communication errors
- Network connectivity issues

## Files Created

- `package.json` - Package configuration with dependencies
- `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration 
- `rollup.config.js` - Build configuration for modules
- `src/index.ts` - Main export file
